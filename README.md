The Recipe Repository is a nearly fully featured web application that appeals to those who want a little variety in their menus.

Use the Generate Menu function under the Menu Maker option to randomly select recipes from our ever growing, open sourced list of recipes. They come complete with descriptions, ingredients and instructions. Enjoy!

Under the Recipe Center option you can add or delete existing recipes. Each recipe added will be available to the possibilities for the Menu Maker. Each recipe deleted will be removed form the Menu Maker.
